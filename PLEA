By now, rlwrap is a rather widely used utility; it can be found in
most free software distros (Most of the Linux flavours, FreeBSD, 
cygwin, Fink)

I do my best to make rlwrap as portable as possible, and it should
*almost* compile out of the box on any reasonably modern Unix-like
system.

However, on any untested system there will be at least *one* little
quirk. Many of those are real bugs in rlwrap, which somehow don't show
up on other systems - a header file may simply live in an unusual
place, but there can also be some race condition that only shows up on
your particular system, or pseudo terminals behave a little
differently on your box.

I don't have the time and motivation to do all the testing myself,
life is too short (and enjoyable) for that.

So, what tends to happen is that package maintainers notice a quirk,
or ugly bug, repair it, put the patch in their package and happily
announce a shiny new rlwrap version.

They forget that other people might profit from their contribution,
that it possibly repairs a bug on many more systems, and that even on
their own platform people actually compile software from source
(gasp!!) instead of using a package from a distribution.


So, please:

Report any problems, and your fixes/patches to me
(hlub@knoware.nl). It will eventually make rlwrap a better piece of
software for everybody, not just for your own community.

Hans.
