Chet Ramey <chet at po.cwru.edu>: author of the amazing readline 
library, around which rlwrap is but a thin wrapper.

Hans Lub hlub@knoware.nl: most of the rlwrap code, except for:

- ptytty.c, wich was taken practically unchanged from rxvt
  (currently maintained by Geoff C. Wing  <gcw@rxvt.org>),
  together with the corresponding part of configure.ac

- completion.c which contains the redblack tree implementation written
  by Damian Ivereigh <damian@cisco.com> (with contributions by 
  Ben Woodard, Eric S. Raymond and Matthias Andree)

Jon Olsson (jon at vexed.se) contributed patches to weed out unsafe
strcat and strcpy calls
